I can absolutely say that the last 10 months have been some of the most challenging in my entire life. The Software Engineering bootcamp has forced me to stretch and grow with the course work. At times I questioned my intelligence and wondered what the hell I was doing in this program. My wife and I decided to start this program last spring after the pandemic forced us to shut down the business we had just started to get off of the ground. 

When life giveâ€™s you lemons pivot and keep moving. We started the program together in July and have managed to complete all of our projects and reviews on time and on pace with our cohort. This may sound like a small win but for us it is a monumental success. We have 3 amazing children and my extraordinary wife found a way to juggle their online learning schedules all while keeping up with the coursework. I work 50-60 hours per week at a high stress 24/7 operations job but every night after the kids were tucked in, we would hit the caffeine and push through the work we needed to accomplish to stay on pace with the program. 

Through it all we just focused on the work and found ways to celebrate the small wins. I truly believe pursuing mastery is an incredible goal and for us it is in the cards on a longer time horizon. Celebrating the small wins and being ok feeling uncomfortable in concepts or reviews has resulted in measurable personal growth. I have learned new ways of thinking and problem solving that extend outside of programming and have been organically integrated into other aspects of my life. 

The end goal has always been to gain the work place flexibility that our family deserves. Time is priceless and the short-term sacrifice of the last year should result in tenfold return of investment in the long term. I was unsure in the beginning but now stand absolute in my determination to become a software engineer. I am excited to move forward and begin the next phase of this journey.
